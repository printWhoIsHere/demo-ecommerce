# Demo E-commerce Project

This project is built using Next.js and is designed learning about routes, APIs, and Prisma. It consists of two main parts:

## demo-ecommerce-admin

This is the admin panel of the e-commerce system. It allows registered users to create their own individual stores. Users can manage their products, orders, and other aspects of their store through this interface.

## demo-ecommerce-store

This part of the project represents the minimal functional e-commerce store. It is designed primarily for testing and showcasing the functionality of the admin panel. Users can browse products, add them to cart, and proceed through the checkout process.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

## Clone the repository.

Navigate to each project (demo-ecommerce-admin and demo-ecommerce-store) and install dependencies using npm i.
Set up the database using Prisma prisma generate.
Start the Next.js server using pnpm run dev.
